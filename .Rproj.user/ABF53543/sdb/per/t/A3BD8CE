A month prior to the workshop, each attendee will receive a datacamp account with a list of assigned courses and assignments. Progress of each student will be monitored by the instructors and a Q &A session will be organized to review the course material at the end of each week. Attendees will only spend 3-4 hours on course material every week. \n</p>\n<p>\nOn the days of the workshop, the knowledge gained from course work will be used to complete a biologialy relevant project.  </p>",
