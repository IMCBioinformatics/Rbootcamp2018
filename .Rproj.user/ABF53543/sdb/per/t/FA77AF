This includes sequence analysis and other bioinformatics tasks.\n<i> No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.</i></p>\n\n<br>\n\n## What you will learn \n\nAt the end of the workshop you will able to:\n\n* Install and update R\n* Use the Rstudio IDE\n* Import a wide variety of data types into R\n* Understand the basic data types: integer, numeric, logical, character\n* Understand Râ€™s basic data structures: vector, matrix, list, data.frame\n* Understand basic programming concepts: functions, objects, loops, vectorization, conditionals\n* Manipulate data structures by subsetting and indexing\n* Understand key base R functions: seq, apply (and friends)\n* Manipulate data with dplyr and friends\n* Make plots with ggplot\n* Understand some common R errors and how to deal with them\n* Find and evaluate R packages needed for a particular analysis\n\n<br>\n\n##Fees\n\nThe fee for this course is 250 CAD.\n\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmrz4Fwh-pZMIa6NZF_PVNIviJQ-DaRP8cKNGrKsKs_Uo0yg/viewform\" class=\"button button1\">Register</a>",
