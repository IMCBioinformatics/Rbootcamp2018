## About this course
<p>

The purpose of this course is to teach scientists (students, postdocs, PIs) in the biological and medical sciences to use R for typical data analysis tasks they might encounter routinely. This includes sequence analysis and other bioinformatics tasks.
<i> No prior knowledge of R is expected and workshop attendees can expect to come away with a skill set that is immediately translatable to their respective data tasks.</i></p>
